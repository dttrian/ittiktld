Windows layout for italian keyboard with backtick and tilde

Developing software or using a terminal with a non-US keyboard can be a pain sometimes, in Windows, because some not so frequently used (but anyway used) chars are missing.
For example, the italian keyboard layout for Windows both misses backtick (`) and tilde (~).

Sometimes you can circumvent the lack of these keys by using some alternative syntax (e.g. $() in a posix shell) but it's not always so handy and in other cases there no alternatives to the ugly Alt+096 or the like.

This is the reason why I decided to create (using [Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22339)) a keyboard layout capable of producing those two characters.

In this new italian keyboard layout I added the possibility to have:

- backtick by pressing AltGr+'
- tilde by pressing AltGr+Ã¬

i.e. the two keys after zero and before backspace.

In this repository you can find the layout source and the binaries produced by [Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22339).

If you are lazy you can just install the new layout (and then add it through the Windows control panel or otherwise you will not be able to use it), otherwise you can get the source file and play a bit with [Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22339). It's fun.
